Dabster 5 is a new file manager featuring interesting encryption and data-hiding features.  You can hide your data inside of bitmaps, without making them look suspicious. Storing data on e-mail accounts is also possible through a POP3/SMTP abstraction layer (it's similar to gmailfs and GMail Drive in this regard). Other protocols are planned to be implemented as the project catches on.
